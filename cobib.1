.SH DESCRIPTION
coBib is a console-based bibliography manager written in Python.
It maintains a plain-text database of literature data in YAML format at
\fI$HOME/.local/share/cobib/literature.yaml\fR.
.PP
coBib provides a variety of \fBSUBCOMMANDS\fR through which you may
investigate and manage the database.
For easy of use it also comes with a curses-based \fBTUI\fR which is
automatically started when no other subcommand is found (more information is
provided in that section).
.PP
coBib also provides some "meta"-commands. These are expained in the \fBSHELL
UTILITIES\fR section.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Prints the version information and exits.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Prints a help message and exits.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Increases the verbosity level of the logging. This option may be provided up to
two times (increasing the logging to \fIinfo\fR and \fIdebug\fR, respectively).
By default, the verbosity of coBib's CLI is set to \fIwarning\fR but if the TUI
is started, logging will be increased to \fIinfo\fR and redirected to
\fIconfig.logging.logfile\fR.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-config " " \fI<path>\fR
Run with an alternate configuration file at \fI<path>\fR.
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-log " " \fI<path>\fR
Run with an alternate log file at \fI<path>\fR.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
All subcommands listed below also provide the \fI\-h\fR and \fI\-\-help\fR
options which provide additional information for each subcommand.
.TP
.B cobib init \fI<args>\fR
Initializes the literature database.
The path to this file can be configured in the \fIDATABASE\fR section of the
configuration file (see also \fBCONFIGURATION\fR).
The only available argument is:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-g ", " \-\-git
.in +4n
Initializes coBib's integrated history tracking through git.
This command will preserve any existing database file, but it is a good idea to
make a backup before doing this, just in case.
Note, that in order to use this functionality you must also enable the
\fIDATABASE/git\fR configuration option (see also \fBCONFIGURATION\fR).
Also be sure to at least set a \fIname\fR and \fIemail\fR in the git config!
.TP
.B cobib add \fI<args>\fR ...
Adds a new entry to the database.
The positional arguments may be used to provide \fItags\fR to associate with the
newly added entries.

.in +4n
Store the newly added entry under the specified \fIlabel\fR.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-u ", " \-\-update
.in +4n
Updates an existing entry with the newly added data. Existing fields will be
overwritten.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-f ", " \-\-file " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Associate the newly added entry with the \fIfile\fR at the provided path.
As of version 2.5 you can specify multiple files, too.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-p ", " \-\-path " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Overwrites the location for the automatically downloaded file. If not specified,
this setting defaults to \fIconfig.utils.file_downloader.default_location\fR.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-\-skip\-download
.in +4n
Skips attempting to automatically download an associated file for the entry.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-\-skip\-existing
.in +4n
Skips entry addition if the label already exists instead of using label
disambiguation to find a new label.
.TP
.B cobib delete \fI<label>\fR
Deletes the entry with the given \fIlabel\fR.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-\-preserve\-files
.in +4n
Only if this is set, associated files will be preserved and \fInot\fR deleted.
.TP
.B cobib edit \fI<label>\fR
Opens the entry with the given \fIlabel\fR in an external editor.
The entry is copied verbatim in \fIYAML\fR format from and to the database file.
The editor respects the \fI$EDITOR\fR environment variable unless overwritten by
\fIconfig.commands.edit.editor\fR. It will fallback to \fIvim\fR if neither is
configured.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-a ", " \-\-add " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Allows editing a non-existing label to manually add it to the database.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-\-preserve\-files
.in +4n
Only if this is set, associated files will be preserved and \fInot\fR renamed if
the edit happens to rename the entry.
.TP
.B cobib modify \fI<modification>\fR \fI<args>\fR ...
Applies a modification to multiple entries at once.
The positional arguments may be used to provide \fBFILTERS\fR which the entries
must match in order to be modified \fIor\fR to provide a list of labels of the
entries which are to be modified (this requires the \fI-s\fR flag to be set).
The \fI<args>\fR may be any of the following:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \fI<modification>\fR
.in +4n
The modification must be provided in the format \fI<field>:<value>\fR and will
set the field of all selected entries to the given value.
As of v3.2.0 the \fI<value>\fR is interpreted as an "f"-string. This means you
can even use placeholder variables and perform simple operations on them. The
available variables depend on the entry which you are modifying as they are
inferred from its stored data. For more information on "f"-strings refer to
section 2.4.3 of https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-\-dry
.in +4n
When this flag is given, the modify command runs in \fIdry\fR mode. This means,
the applied modifications are printed to stdout rather than applied directly.
This allows easy prototyping of modifications to prevent errors during large
bulk modifications.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-a ", " \-\-add
.in +4n
Specifying this flag will add the modification's value to the specified field of
the entry rather than overwriting it. In doing so, strings will be concatenated
with\fBOUT\fR any spaces, lists will be appended to, numbers will be added, and
anything else will be converted to a string field.
If the field did not exist previously, it will simply be initialized with the
new value.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-s ", " \-\-selection
.in +4n
This boolean flag enables the \fIselection\fR mode in which the positional args
are interpreted as a list of labels which are to be exported. The name for this
argument is a result of the TUI's selection interface.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-\-preserve\-files
.in +4n
Only if this is set, associated files will be preserved and \fInot\fR renamed if
the modification happens to rename the entry.
.TP
.B cobib undo \fI<args>\fR
If you enabled the git-integration of coBib (available since v2.6.0) you can
undo the changes done to your database file by commands such as add, edit and
delete. See also \fIDATABASE/git\fR in the \fBCONFIGURATION\fR section for more
information.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-f ", " \-\-force
.in +4n
Overwrites the check for an auto-committed change. Thus, the undo command will
now undo the last commit with a message that does not start with "Undo".
.TP
.B cobib redo
If you enabled the git-integration of coBib (available since v2.6.0) you can
reapply the last undone changes (see above). See also \fIDATABASE/git\fR in the
\fBCONFIGURATION\fR section for more information.
.TP
.B cobib open \fI<label>\fR
Opens any associated \fIfile\fR of the entry with the given \fIlabel\fR.
If multiple files are associated with the entry, the user can choose which
file(s) to open through an interactive menu.
.TP
.B cobib show \fI<label>\fR
Prints the entry with the given \fIlabel\fR in \fIBibLaTex\fR format to stdout.
.TP
.B cobib list \fI<args>\fR
Lists all entries of the database in a basic table format to stdout which match
the specified \fBFILTERS\fR (more information is provided in that section).
Additionally, the following \fI<args>\fR are also allowed:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-l ", " \-\-long
.in +4n
Print the table in \fIlong\fR format, i.e. without wrapping the lines to fit the
current terminal width.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-s ", " \-\-sort " " \fI<field>\fI
.in +4n
Specify the entry field to use as the \fIsorting column\fR of the table.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-r ", " \-\-reverse
.in +4n
Reverses the sorting order.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-x ", " \-\-or
.in +4n
Concatenate the filters using logical \fIOR\fR rather than the default
\fIAND\fR.
.TP
.B cobib search \fI<args>\fR ...
Searches the database recursively (i.e. including any associated files) for the
specified keyword.
The positional arguments may be used to provide \fBFILTERS\fR which the entries
must match in order to be included in the export.
Additionally, the following \fI<args>\fR are also allowed:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-c ", " \-\-context " " \fI<int>\fI
.in +4n
Specify the number of context lines to provide for each match.
This values defaults to 1.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-i ", " \-\-ignore-case
.in +4n
Makes the search case-insensitive.
.TP
.B cobib export \fI<args>\fR ...
Exports the database.
The positional arguments may be used to provide \fBFILTERS\fR which the entries
must match in order to be included in the export \fIor\fR to provide a list of
labels of the entries which are to be exported (this requires the \fI-s\fR flag
to be set).
The \fI<args>\fR may be any of the following:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-b ", " \-\-bibtex " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Export the entries to a \fIBibLaTex\fR file at the specified path.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-z ", " \-\-zip " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Export a \fIBibLaTex\fR file of the entries and all of the associated files into
a single \fIZIP\fR file at the specified path.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-s ", " \-\-selection
.in +4n
This boolean flag enables the \fIselection\fR mode in which the positional args
are interpreted as a list of labels which are to be exported. The name for this
argument is a result of the TUI's selection interface.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-a ", " \-\-abbreviate
.in +4n
Causes all Journal names to be abbreviated. For this option to take effect, a
list of abbreviations must be configured via
\fIconfig.utils.journal_abbreviations\fR.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-\-dotless
.in +4n
Works in conjunction with the \fIabbreviate\fR argument in order to remove
punctuation from the journal abbreviations.
.SH FILTERS
In order to limit the output of the \fIlist\fR, \fImodify\fR, \fIsearch\fR, and
\fIexport\fR commands you can apply additional filters via keyword arguments.
Their availability depends on your database since they are added to the argument
parser at runtime.
However, you can find a full list for your specific case with \fIcobib list
\-\-help\fR.
.PP
The general syntax for filtering is the following
.in +8n
[\fB++\fR|\fB\-\-\fR]\fB<field>\fR \fI<value>\fR
.in
which is to be understood as the following:
When the keyword argument is started with \fB++\fR the entry must positively
\fImatch\fR this filter; if started with \fB\-\-\fR it must \fINOT\fR match.
The \fB<field>\fR may be any available field in your database.
It should be noted, that this string is matched exactly which means no plurals
are allowed.
The \fI<value>\fR finally specifies what is matched against. As of version
v3.2.0 this value gets interpreted as a regex pattern, enabling powerful filter
matching.
.PP
In general, multiple filters provided to the \fIlist\fR and \fIexport\fR
commands are combined with logical \fIAND\fR.
This may be overwritten by adding the \fI\-x\fR or \fI\-\-or\fR arguments as
described in the arguments section of the \fIlist\fR command.
.SH EXAMPLES
This section provides a few examples of \fBFILTERS\fR as described above.
.TP
.B cobib list ++year 2020
Lists only entries which were published in 2020.
.TP
.B cobib list --tags chemistry
Lists only entries without the `chemistry` tag.
.TP
.B cobib list ++year 2019 ++tags quantum
Lists only entries with the `quantum` tag from the year 2019.
.TP
.B cobib list -x ++year 2019 ++year 2020
Lists only entries published in 2019 or 2020.
.SH TUI
The curses-based TUI is started automatically when no other subcommand is
supplied, i.e. by simply running \fBcobib\fR.
By default, it lists all entries of the database in a buffer which may be
scrolled in vim-fashion with \fIh,j,k,l,^B,^U,^D,^F\fR.
The arrow and paging keys are also available for scrolling.
The following default key bindings are available:
.TP
.BR q " " quit
Quits one level of the viewing buffer.
.TP
.BR ? " " help
Opens a small window providing help for the key bindings.
.TP
.BR ENTER " " show
Populates the viewing buffer with a BibLaTex view of the selected entry.
.TP
.BR o " " open
Opens the current (or \fIselected\fR) label(s).
.TP
.BR w " " wrap
Toggles wrapping of the viewing buffer.
.TP
.BR a " " add
Opens a command prompt which allows running the \fBadd\fR command as if outside
of the TUI.
.TP
.BR d " " delete
Deletes the current (or \fIselected\fR) label(s).
.TP
.BR e " " edit
Opens the current label in an external editor.
.TP
.BR m " " modify

outside of the TUI. If a \fIselection\fR is present, the \fI-s\fR argument will
be set automatically.
.TP
.BR u " " undo
Undoes the last auto-committed change to the database file.
This requires the git-integration (since v2.6.0) to be enabled!
.TP
.BR r " " redo
Reapplies the last undone change.
This requires the git-integration (since v2.6.0) to be enabled!
.TP
.BR / " " search
Opens a search prompt and views the results in the viewing buffer.
.TP
.BR f " " filter
Allows adding filters to the list view.
.TP
.BR s " " sort
Allows sorting the list view.
.TP
.BR v " " select
Adds the current label to the \fIselection\fR.
.TP
.BR x " " export
Opens a command prompt which allows running the \fBexport\fR command as if
outside of the TUI. If a \fIselection\fR is present, the \fI-s\fR argument will
be set automatically.
.TP
.BR : " " prompt
Opens a command prompt allowing the user to execute an arbitrary coBib CLI
command.
.SH CONFIGURATION
Since version 3.0, coBib can be configured directly via \fIPython\fR. To do so,
you must place the configuration file at \fI$HOME/.config/cobib/config.py\fR.
If you don't have a configuration file yet, you can get started by copying the
well-documented example configuration to the right location via:
.in +4n
    \fIcobib _example_config > ~/.config/cobib/config.py\fR
.in -4n
If you do have an old configuration file (prior to v3.0) and would like some
guidance on how to migrate it, please read this short blog post of mine:
https://mrossinek.gitlab.io/programming/cobibs-new-configuration/
.PP
The following section summarizes the syntax and all possibly settings, for
completeness.
.TP
.BR Configuration " " Syntax
Internally, coBib's configuration is nothing but a (nested) Python dictionary.
Thus, after importing the config with
.in +4n
    \fIfrom cobib.config import config\fR
.in -4n
it is very straight forward to change any setting by simply changing the value
stored in the dictionary. For example:
.in +4n
    \fIconfig['database']['git'] = True\fR
.in -4n
However, for ease of use, all of the fields are also exposed as attributes. This
means, the same can be achieved via:
.in +4n
    \fIconfig.database.git = True\fR
.in -4n
.PP
.BR LOGGING
.TP
.IR config.logging.logfile = '~/.cache/cobib/cobib.log'
This setting sets the path to the default logfile. This logfile can be
overwritten using the \fI--logfile\fR command-line argument.
.TP
.IR config.logging.version = '~/.cache/cobib/version'
In this file, the last run version of coBib gets cached. After an update, coBib
automtically prints the newest section of the Changelog. To disable this
functionality entirely, set this option to \fINone\fR.
.PP
.BR COMMANDS
.TP
.IR config.commands.edit.default_entry_type = 'article'
This setting indicates the default entry type which will be used for manually
entered entries.
.TP
.IR config.commands.edit.editor = $EDITOR " if available else " 'vim'
This setting can be used to overwrite the external editor used for manual
editing of database entries. It defaults to the environment variable
\fI$EDITOR\fR and falls back to \fIvim\fR if that is not set either.
.TP
.IR config.commands.open.command = 'xdg-open' " (on Linux); " 'open' " (on Mac OS)"
Specifies the program used to open associated files.
.TP
.IR config.commands.search.grep = 'grep'
Specifies the program used to search in associated files.
.TP
.IR config.commands.search.grep_args = []
Allows the specification of additional arguments for the \fIgrep\fR command.
.TP
.IR config.commands.search.ignore_case = False
This boolean setting indicates whether search defaults to be case-insensitive.
.PP
.BR DATABASE
.TP
.IR config.database.file = '~/.local/share/cobib/literature.yaml'
This setting sets the path to the database file. You can use \fI~\fR to
represent your \fI$HOME\fR directory.
.TP
.IR config.database.git = False
This boolean field indicates whether the database file should automatically be
tracked in a git repository.
Note, that you must initialize the git-tracking with \fIcobib init --git\fR. If
you already have an existing database file, it will be preserved. Nonetheless,
it is a good idea to make a backup before doing so, just in case.
Also be sure to at least set a \fIname\fR and \fIemail\fR in the git config!
.TP
.IR config.database.format.label_default = '{label}'
This field specifies the default label format in an f-string modification style
as interpreted by the \fImodify\fR command. The default setting leaves the label
unchanged from the import resource proposal. A simple example which uses the
first authors surname and year is \fI'{author.split()[1]}{year}'\fR.
.TP
.IR config.database.format.label_suffix = ('_',\ LabelSuffix.ALPHA)
This field specifies the default label disambiguator. The option takes a tuple
of length 2, where the first entry is the string separating the proposed label
from the disambiguator and the second one is one of the enumerators provided by
\ficonfig.LabelSuffix\fR.
.TP
.IR config.database.format.suppress_latex_warnings = True
This boolean field indicates whether latex warnings will be ignored during the
escaping of special characters.
.TP
Some fields are internally stored as lists. Upon conversion to the BibTeX
format, these need to be converted to a basic string. In this process the
entries of the list will be joined using the separators configured by the
following settings.
.TP
.IR config.database.stringify.list_separator.file = ',\ '
.TP
.IR config.database.stringify.list_separator.tags = ',\ '
.TP
.IR config.database.stringify.list_separator.url = ',\ '
.PP
.BR PARSERS
.TP
.IR config.parsers.bibtex.ignore_non_standard_types = False
This boolean setting indicates whether non-standard BibLaTex entry types should
be ignored or not.
.PP
.BR TUI
.TP
.IR config.tui.default_list_args = ['\-l']
This can be set to a list of default arguments to use for the TUI's list view.
.TP
.IR config.tui.prompt_before_quit = True
This setting specifies whether the user is prompted to verify the final quit
operation.
.TP
.IR config.tui.reverse_order = True
This setting specifies whether the database is listed in reverse order by
default. This is useful because the most recently added entries will be at the
top.
.TP
.IR config.tui.scroll_offset = 3
This setting specifies the scrolling offset used to prevent the cursor line from
coming too close to the ends of the screen while scrolling.  The intent of this
setting is to provide a similar behavior as the 'scrolloff' option available in
Vim. Note, that you can pin the cursor line to the center of the screen by
setting this option to a very large value (e.g. 99).
.PP
.BR TUI.COLORS
With the following settings you can change the look of the TUI. Each of these
settings accepts any of the following color names: \fIblack\fR, \fIred\fR,
\fIgreen\fR, \fIyellow\fR, \fIblue\fR, \fImagenta\fR, \fIcyan\fR and
\fIwhite\fR.
.TP

.TP
.IR config.tui.colors.selection_fg = 'white'
.TP
.IR config.tui.colors.selection_bg = 'magenta'
.PP
.BR TUI.KEY_BINDINGS
You can change the default key bindings of the TUI by overwriting any of the
following settings with a different key. Any setting will interpret the provided
string as a single character whose ASCII value is used for triggering the
command.
The only exception is the \fIENTER\fR string, which will be internally mapped to
the ASCII codes 10 (\fIline feed\fR) and 13 (\fIcarriage return\fR).

.BR UTILS
.TP
.IR config.utils.file_downloader.default_location = '~/.local/share/cobib'
This setting sets the default location for any downloaded associated files.
.TP
.IR config.utils.file_downloader.url_map = {}
You can provide rules to map from a journal's landing page URL to its PDF URL.
To do so, you must insert an entry into the following dictionary, with a
regex-pattern matching the journal's landing page URL and a value being the PDF
URL. E.g.:

    config.utils.file_downloader.url_map[
        r"(.+)://aip.scitation.org/doi/([^/]+)"
    ] = r"\1://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/\2"

    config.utils.file_downloader.url_map[
        r"(.+)://quantum-journal.org/papers/([^/]+)"
    ] = r"\1://quantum-journal.org/papers/\2/pdf/"

Make sure to use raw Python strings to ensure proper backslash-escaping.
.TP
.IR config.utils.journal_abbreviations = []
You can specify a list of journal abbreviations. This list should be formatted
as tuples of the form: \fB(full journal name, abbreviation)\fR. The abbreviation
should include any necessary punctuation which can be excluded upon export (see
also \fIcobib export --help\fR).
.PP
.BR EVENTS
.TP
Since v3.3.0 coBib comes with a number of subscribable events. Their
configuration is detailed in the online documentation,
