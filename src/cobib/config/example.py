"""An example configuration for coBib.

This module duplicates the default values of `cobib.config.config` in the format of how users would
overwrite any settings. The contents of this module can be extracted using:
```bash
cobib _example_config
```
This dumps the contents to `stdout`. They can be redirected to a desired location like so:
```bash
cobib _example_config > ~/.config/cobib/config.py
```

You can read a description of all available configuration options:
- in the file below (click on `View Source` when viewing this page online)
- at the module-level documentation of `cobib.config`
- in the `cobib-config(5)` manpage (which is rendered online at the previous link)

# [text-unidecode](https://pypi.org/project/text-unidecode/), replacing all Unicode symbols with
# pure ASCII ones. A more useful example is
#     `"{unidecode(author[0].last)}{year}"`

# (assuming `config.database.format.author_format = AuthorFormat.YAML`),
# replacing all Unicode characters with ASCII, and immediately appends the `year`.

# The first element is the string used to separate the base label from the enumerator; by default,
# an underscore is used. The second element is one of the `Enum` values of
# `cobib.config.config.LabelSuffix`:

# but here is simple example to add an intense splash of color:

# If this is `None`, its default behavior will try to ensure a _transparent_ background. When
# running in the CLI, this implies a value of `"default"`; inside the TUI, textual's _$panel_ color

# theme. Otherwise, this should be the name of a supported pygments theme.

# details.

# THEME.TAGS

# It is possible to configure special highlighting (or _markup_) for entries with certain _tags_.

# and a string describing the `rich.style.Style`.

# The markup for entries with the `high` tag.

#
# Note, that this tag does **not** get added automatically.
# But you can do so by subscribing to the _PostAddCommand_ event (see also _cobib-event(7)_):
#    ```python
#    from cobib.config import Event
#
#    @Event.PostAddCommand.subscribe
#    def add_new_tag(cmd: AddCommand) -> None:
#        for entry in cmd.new_entries.values():

#    ```
config.theme.tags.new = TagMarkup(10, "bold bright_cyan")

# The _tags_ must be lower case, start with a letter, and only contain letters or the characters
# `.`, `-`, or `_`.
config.theme.tags.user_tags = {}

# TUI

# A list of preset _cobib-filter(7)_ arguments available for quick access in the TUI.
# The first 9 entries of this list can be triggered by pressing the corresponding number in the TUI.
# Pressing `0` resets the filter to the standard list view.
#
# Each entry of this list should be a string describing a _cobib-filter(7)_, for example:
#    ```python
#    config.tui.preset_filters = [
#        "++tags new",   # filters entries with the `new` tag
#        "++year 2023",  # filters entries from the year 2023
#    ]
#    ```

#
# Populating this dictionary will improve the success rate of the automatic file download. You can
# find more examples in the [wiki](https://gitlab.com/cobib/cobib/-/wikis/File-Downloader-URL-Maps),
# but here is a simple one:

#    config.utils.file_downloader.url_map[
#        r"(.+)://quantum-journal.org/papers/([^/]+)"
#    ] = r"\1://quantum-journal.org/papers/\2/pdf/"
