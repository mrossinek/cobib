"""coBib's subscribable events.

### Available Events

There are various kinds of event types:
    - Pre*Command: these fire before a command gets executed. Hooks subscribing to these events
      are passed an instance of the command which will be populated with the original command-line
      arguments as well as the resulting `argparse.Namespace`.
    - Post*Command: these fire after a command got executed but (generally) **before** the
      Database gets written to file, allowing final touch-ups and modifications to take place.
      Just like the `Pre*Command` events, the input will be an instance of the command through which
      a user can modify the command data at runtime.
    - Pre*Import: these fire before an importer gets executed. Hooks subscribing to these events
      are passed an instance of the importer which will be populated with the original command-line
      arguments as well as the resulting `argparse.Namespace`.
    - Post*Import: these fire after an importer got executed but (generally) **before** the
      Database gets written to file, allowing final touch-ups and modifications to take place.
      Just like the `Pre*Import` events, the input will be an instance of the importer through which
      a user can modify the command data at runtime.
    - Pre*Parse: just like the Pre-Command events, these fire before a parser runs. As an input
      they generally get the driver input.
    - Post*Parse: these fire after a parser ran. They again allow final touch-ups of the
      generated dictionary of new entries.
    - Pre*Dump: these fire before an entry gets dumped. The hook can pre-process the entry to
      its desire. Changes will not become persistent in the Database.
    - Post*Dump: these fire after an entry got formatted as a string. The string can be
      post-processed with some final touch-ups.
    - and finally there a few specific events not belonging to any of the categories mentioned
      above, examples of which are the `PreGitCommit` and `PostGitCommit` events.

All events are listed below.

### Usage

You can register a function to be executed when a certain event gets triggered as shown in the
following example:
```python
from os import system
from cobib.config import Event
from cobib.commands import InitCommand

@Event.PostInitCommand.subscribe
def add_remote(cmd: InitCommand) -> None:
    system(f"git -C {cmd.root} remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo")
```
The above example gets run after the `init` command has finished. It adds a remote to the git
repository. This can be useful in combination with automatic pushing to the remote like done here:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from os import system
from cobib.config import Event

@Event.PostGitCommit.subscribe
def push_to_remote(root: Path, file: Path) -> None:
    system(f"git -C {root} push origin master")
```

It is important that you include the type hints as part of the function definition because these are
used during the config validation.

You can also subscribe the same function to multiple events at once as shown in the following
(rather non-sensible) example:
```python
from typing import Dict
from cobib.database import Entry

@Event.PostArxivParse.subscribe
@Event.PostDOIParse.subscribe
@Event.PostISBNParse.subscribe
def print_new_entries(bib: Dict[str, Entry) -> None:
    print("New entries being added: ", list(bib.keys()))
```

You can find some useful examples on
[this wiki page](https://gitlab.com/cobib/cobib/-/wikis/Useful-Event-Hooks).
