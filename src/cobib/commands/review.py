"""coBib's Review command.

This command allows you to review the entries of your database to quickly make changes as you go.
This is especially helpful as your knowledge of your database changes and develops with time.

In its simplest form, you can review your entire database in an interactive manner with the
following command:
```
cobib review
```

Since this can be quite a lot all at once, you can also narrow your review down using filters (see
also `cobib.commands.list_`) just like with some of the other commands. For example, the following
command reviews all entries from the year 2023:
```
cobib review -- ++year 2023
```
You can also specify a manual selection of labels (or visually select them in the TUI (see below)):
```
cobib review --selection -- Label1 Label2 ...
```

You can also narrow your review down to one or more fields of all the entries:
```
cobib review tags -- ++year 2023
cobib review ENTRYTYPE year
```
When restricting your review like the above, you will only get a preview of the selected set of
fields. If you require more context, you can either request that interactively (see below) or
provide the `--context` option like so:
```
cobib review --context ENTRYTYPE
```

### How it works

For every label that you review, you will be presented with its contents and asked to select an
action that you would like to take. Your choices are the following:

- `edit`: opens the entry in your `cobib.config.config.EditCommandConfig.editor` and allows you to
          freely modify it.
- `done`: indicates that you are happy with this entry and completes its review.
- `skip`: skips the review of the current entry indicating that you do not want to make any changes
          but also do not mark it as `done` (which means that when resuming a review, it will come
          up again).
- `context`: requests additional context and updates the preview to contain all the information
             stored in the entry. This action is only available when context has not been requested
             yet and when fields are being filtered in the first place.
- `finish`: closes the review process (even if some entries have not been reviewed yet) and saves
            your progress to the database. This allows you to perform reviews in smaller chunks
            because you can resume from the current review state at another time.
- `inline`: allows you to edit a specific field in-line (i.e. without having to open the entry in an
            external editor). When reviewing a single field, you can simply type `inline` to edit
            that one. When reviewing more than one, you need to specify which field you want to edit
            in-line like so: `inline <field>`. This is a highly experimental feature so please be
            aware of bugs and report any issues or suggestions online:
            https://gitlab.com/cobib/cobib/-/issues/new

### Resuming a previously started review

If you finished a review early (see `finish` above) you can easily continue where you left of with
the `--resume` option. This option takes a git commit identifier as its argument so you should
either find the SHA of the auto-commit of the review that you would like to continue (see also
`cobib.commands.git.GitCommand`), or if you know that it is (for example) the last thing that you
did, you can simply use `HEAD` as shown below:
```
cobib review --resume HEAD
```
In this way, you do not need to repeat any filters that you may have used and coBib will
automatically know which entries you have marked as `done` and will not show them to you again.
However, entries which you used `skip` on before, will now show up again.

### Additional options

There are some additional options to the `review` command.

You can indicate which entries of a review you have already completed with the `--done` argument:
```
cobib review --done Author2023 -- ++year 2023
```
The example above will review all entries from the year 2023, except for `Autho2023`. It is unlikely
that you will ever use this option manually if you have `cobib.config.config.DatabaseConfig.git`
enabled, because that will allow you to resume a previously started review more easily.


### TUI

You can also trigger this command from the `cobib.ui.tui.TUI`.
By default, it is bound to the `c` key (as in "check") which will drop you into the prompt where you
can type out a normal command-line command:
```
:review <arguments go here>
```

.. note::
   If you have already selected one or more entries, the `--selection` argument will automatically
   be added.

        * `-d`, `--done`: specifies a list of labels which will not be included in the review even
