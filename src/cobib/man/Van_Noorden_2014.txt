The paper mountain
If you were to print out just the first page
of every item indexed in Web of Science,
the stack of paper would reach almost to
the top of Mt Kilimanjaro. Only the top
metre and a half of that stack would have
received 1,000 citations or more, and just
a centimetre and a half would have been
cited more than 10,000 times. All of the
top 100 are cited more than 12,000 times,
besting some of the most recognizable
scientific discoveries in history.

Top-10 papers
Just 3 papers have received more than 100,000
citatins, putting them well ahead of the rest. These
runaway hits all cover biological lab techniques, which
in general dominate the list of most-cited literature,
including 7 of the top 10.
